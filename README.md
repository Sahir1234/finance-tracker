# My Online Finance Tracker!

## Starting Up The App

Install Node.js version 12 or above. This should give you the npm command as well. In the home project directory, run "npm install" and that should give you all the node modules that the project relies on. Then, you have to start the SQL server using "sudo mysql.server start". From the root project directory, you can run the main.js file. Once the server is running, open index.html to run the app and that's it.
(Note that these are the instructions for running the app locally because I only ran it locally in development).

## Using it to Track Events

APP STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, WILL BE COMPLETED SOON...

## Future Development

One idea that could be used to make this app truly special is incorporating the Twilio API. Using Twilio, the app could be slightly redesigned so that users can log new expense entries into their tracker by texting a phone number. The server could then process this message and modify the databse accordingly. This would make the app something more than just a basic online finance tracker.
